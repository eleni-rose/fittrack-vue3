## Fit Track - a fitness social media blog. Built with Vue3, Express, BulmaCSS, and MongoDB.
Built during the Fall 2022 Semester at SUNY New Paltz for Web Programming 493.

As a social media blog service, this web application allows public users to create accounts either via email or Google integration and have an array of CRUD features that allow them to post and interact with other posts.
Users can upload posts with images and hashtags, remove posts, and edit their own current posts. Users can upload and remove profile images and edit their public profile.

Future versions will allow for a "friends" system where users can search for others, view public profile information, add friends to a friends list, and have access to a Facebook-esque timeline feature. This will curate their activity page to show their friends' recent blog posts and allow them some basic interactions such as comments and likes.
